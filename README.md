# I2C_VIP
Verification of the I2C Protocol with UVM
In this project, I completed the basic communication between a single master and a single slave using 7-bit addressing in standard mode.
I'm still working on the VIP, making the necessary adjustments and trying to make it more modular and reusable.
In the future, I'd like to make it a 10-bit addressing mode with multi-master and multi-slave support, as well as cover I2C features like bus arbitration and clock stretching across all modes and reset configurations.
